# Face Verification with Siamese Network üñºÔ∏è

## Introduction to Face Verification üßë‚Äçüíª

This project aims to develop an AI system for face verification using a Siamese network. The goal is to verify whether a person in an image is present in a database, similar to photo-based screen locks on mobile devices. The system uses a Siamese network trained with a triplet loss function, allowing it to distinguish between known and unknown faces effectively. This implementation achieves 100% precision and recall, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability.

## Project Workflow Overview üóÇÔ∏è

The face verification process in our project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Model Architecture**
3. **Training with Triplet Loss**
4. **Face Verification**
5. **Evaluation**

Each step is crucial for building an accurate and reliable face verification system.

### 1. Data Collection üì∏

#### Positive Samples
- **Source**: Random images of myself.
- **Method**: Collected using OpenCV to capture multiple images from different angles and lighting conditions.

#### Negative Samples
- **Source**: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.
- **Method**: Randomly selected images from the LFW dataset, ensuring a diverse set of faces not present in the positive samples.

### 2. Model Architecture üèóÔ∏è

#### Siamese Network
A Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture that learns to differentiate between two input images by comparing their feature representations.

#### Architecture Details
- **Input**: Two images (Anchor and either Positive or Negative).
- **Base Network**: Shared Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that extracts features from both input images.
- **Output**: Feature vectors representing each input image, which are compared to determine similarity.

### 3. Training with Triplet Loss üéì

#### Triplet Loss Function
The triplet loss function helps the network learn to distinguish between similar and dissimilar images by minimizing the distance between an anchor and a positive image while maximizing the distance between the anchor and a negative image.

#### Training Process
- **Anchor**: An image from the positive samples.
- **Positive**: Another image of the same person as the anchor.
- **Negative**: An image of a different person from the LFW dataset.
- The network is trained to ensure that the distance between the anchor and positive images is less than the distance between the anchor and negative images by a margin.

### 4. Face Verification ‚úîÔ∏è

#### Verification Process
- **Input**: An image of the person to be verified.
- **Comparison**: The input image is compared against images in the database using the trained Siamese network.
- **Decision**: The system verifies whether the input image matches any image in the database based on the similarity scores.

### 5. Evaluation üìä

#### Metrics
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive verifications out of all positive verifications.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive verifications out of all actual positives in the database.

#### Evaluation Process
- The model is tested on a separate validation set containing both known and unknown faces.
- Performance metrics are calculated to assess the system's effectiveness, achieving 100% precision and recall.

## Conclusion üéâ

This project demonstrates the use of a Siamese network for face verification, leveraging triplet loss for effective training. The system achieves 100% precision and recall, showcasing its accuracy and reliability in distinguishing between known and unknown faces. This implementation is similar to photo-based screen locks on mobile devices, offering a robust solution for face verification.

## Future Directions üöÄ

1. **Improved Data Augmentation**: Enhance the training process with more advanced data augmentation techniques.
2. **Real-Time Verification**: Implement real-time face verification for security applications.
3. **Larger Datasets**: Incorporate larger and more diverse datasets to improve the model's robustness and generalization.
4. **Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly application or API for easy integration with other systems.
